title: Mercado Bairro Alto.
deliverables: Logo & Branding, Illustrations
description: The main goal of the project was to create unique, creative space providing local artists the opportunity to present, display and sell their artworks. It's a perfect place to find quirky items, paintings, vintage clothes, but also see exhibitions, concerts and live performances. The design pattern used in the logo and visual identity is inspired by the traditional Portuguese pavement called Calsada.
