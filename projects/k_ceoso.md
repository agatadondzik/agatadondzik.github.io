                The St Vincent the Paul Sociaty (Vinnies) CEO Sleepout is an exclusive event that brings together leaders in business, community and government. Participants sleep without shelter on one of the longest nights of the year to raise awareness, fundraise and help change the lives of Australians experiencing homelessness.
            </p>
            <p class="project-content">
                The event has become a great success over the past few years and has established itself as one of the most iconic fundraising events in Australia raising over 5.6 million dollars for people experiencing homelessness last year.

            <h1 class="project-header">Challenge.</h1>
            <p class="project-content">
                Current fundraising process is complicated. The organisation has recognised the need to develop more compelling and unique experience that better engages with participants and donors.
            </p>
            <h1 class="project-header">Approach.</h1>
            <p class="project-content">
                In order to understand exisiting limitations, user needs and opportunities I performed a number of activities including interviews with participants (CEOs) and event coordinators as well as number of workshops and ideation sessions with the client.
            </p>
            <p class="project-content">
                We decided to build our solution on top of an exisiting crowdfunding platform called Funraisin. We needed to understand its functionality to fully leverage its potential and build a solution that is tailored to the event.
            </p>
            <h1 class="project-header">My role.</h1>
            <p class="project-content">
                I led the discovery and research phase, helped prioritise functionality and content, facilitated ideation sessions and workshops as well as led design execution of the project including sketching, prototyping and producing final designs. Additionally, I presented works to gain buy‐in from stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.
            </p>
           <h1 class="project-header">Solution.</h1>
            <p class="project-content">
                User centric digital solution that creates seamless experience by removing friction points during donation process and simplifies signups.

                <strong>Results:</strong><br>
                59% uplift in average donation amount.<br>
                29% uplift in conversion rate.<br>
                118% uplift in transactions.

        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            <strong>As a first step I performed a number of activities to help us immerse in the project, understand the context and identify participants goals.</strong>        
        </p>
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            Firstly, our team run the Business Context Workshop with the client to understand the background and business context behind the CEO Sleepout website and Event Coordinator workshop to unfold insights on how the website is managed from an administrative point of view and identify any pain points.
        </p>
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            Secondly, I interviewed around twenty CEOs to learn what motivates them to participate in the event, how they use the website and what could be improved. That was very insightful activity. I performed a user centric UX/UI review on the exiting website in order to identify what’s working well and where improvements can be made as well as a global best practice review to explore inspirational examples of online fundraising / event-based websites and apps from around the world.
        </p>
        <img class="project-images-img" src="/assets/projects/ceoso_/b_ceoso_b.jpg" alt="image" />
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            To gain better in-depth understanding our team decided to participate in the event and sleep rough on the longest night of the year. It was tough but extremely insightful since we got the opportunity to hear stories from people who have suffered homelessness and engaged with participants to understand their motivations.
        </p>
        <img class="project-images-img" src="/assets/projects/ceoso_/c_ceoso_c.jpg" alt="image" />
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            <strong>Selected key insights from the discovery phase:</strong>  
        </p>
        <ul class="project-content-verbose project-content dashed">
            <li>CEOs find the registration process complicated and look for a quick way to approach their network.</li>
            <li>They are motivated by the competition and found real stories from people who have experienced homelessness very powerful.</li>
            <li>They find it difficult to track their donations.</li>
            <li>Donors don’t know what the “standard” donation amount is.</li>
            <li>National vs state coordination is a challenge.</li>
            <li>Donation process is lacking important info and where the donations go.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            After gathering all the insights and inputs I synthesised the findings in order to define themes and opportunities and built journey maps. At the end of this phase I defined a clear hypothesis and had enough understanding to generate potential ideas.
        </p>
        <img class="project-images-img" src="/assets/projects/ceoso_/d_ceoso_d.jpg" alt="image" />
        
        <img class="section-numbers" src="/assets/projects/ceoso_/2-ideation.jpg" alt="image" />
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            At this phase, I focused on creating a framework and wireframes to share the vision, communicate design principals and content strategy. This was very helpful to gain alignment, justify design decisions and prioritise content.
        </p>
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            The key objective was to balance customer and business goals while still keeping it feasible.        
        </p>
        <img class="project-images-img-25" src="/assets/projects/ceoso_/e_ceoso_e.jpg" alt="image" />
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            The first step I took to define a new information architecture was mapping out all the content. I teamed up with a copywriter and laveraged learnings from the discovery phase, user goals and exisiting data to consolidate, declutter or remove content. Some of the key actions were to reduce long form body copy, produce more guiding headings, short copy that drives call to action and more task-focused content. As a result, we defined a simple and intuitive navigation and presented content strategy for the new website.
        </p>
        <img class="project-images-img" src="/assets/projects/ceoso_/f_ceoso_f.jpg" alt="image" />

        <strong>Overcoming the challenge/Communicating designs:</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            The biggest challenge I faced throughout this project was balancing moving forward with designs, whilst collaborating with the wider team. Since this project touched many parts of the organisation, I needed to coordinate and get buy‐in from national teams and state coordinators that were both co‐located and distributed.
        </p>
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            Managing feedback was even more challenging trying to accomodate different viewpoints. To overcome this challenge we decided to consolidate feedback that from now on was prioritised and presented to us by the product owner only.
        </p>
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            Design principles and the content prioritisation framework helped create visibility into my decision‐making process and galvanise the team to share in the vision. By the end of this phase we all had a clear understanding on the scope, features and we were confident that everyone is aligned on the vision and the product we’re going to build.
        </p>
        <img class="project-images-img" src="/assets/projects/ceoso_/g_ceoso_g.jpg" alt="image" />
        <p class="img-caption">
            Content mapping, design principals and clearly defined user goals helped create visibility.

        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            <strong>High fidelity, feedback from stakeholder, testing.</strong>    
        </p>
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            That’s when I started to make it all real by bringing the ideas to life. We ensured the team is in the loop and run fortnightly showcases where all national and state teams could participate and see the progress on the designs.

            <strong>Donation process.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            We’ve created easily accessible donation module that exists on the homepage as well as on the participant page. It presents tangible targets and suggests a preferred donation.
        </p>
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            Additionally, donation page includes information about where your money goes and stories from real people who have suffered homelessness sharing their struggles and how Vinnies has supported them throughout their journey.

            <strong>Fundraising process.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            During the discovery session we've defined the competitiveness as important aspect of fundraising and a great motivation for the CEOs. In order to address it, I introduced a leaderboard and a self-donation during registration process.
        </p>
        <img class="project-images-img" src="/assets/projects/ceoso_/j_ceoso_j.jpg" alt="image" />
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            On top of that, every participant gets an access to their dashboard where they can track donations, update profile and access resources to support their fundraising efforts. Platform allows to view their previous donations, read personal notes from donors, adjust their target, and many more.
