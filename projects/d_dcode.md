description: I had the pleasure of developing a creative concept and overall artwork for this amazing large scale event dealing directly with clients and suppliers. I've also created illustrations representing fun characters as part of the visual identity to keep young coders smiling when they get tired. The event was a huge success and we all had a lot of fun!
about: D-code Bootcamp is a 3-day intensive coding bootcamp facilitated by experts from Silicon Valley, USA to teach young people coding and show some tricks in this amazing science! The youth had the chance to compete for a full scholarship to attend a basecamp at Silicon Valley, USA.
