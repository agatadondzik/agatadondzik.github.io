                Bicycle Network is Australia’s biggest bike riding organisation, supported by more than 50,000 members nationwide. Their mission is to make it easier for everybody to ride a bike, every day.

            One of the most interesting activities throughout this phase was learning about different types of riders, their divergent safety concerns and confidence on the road. After analysing provided data, user behaviour and running a prioritisation session we agreed on our main target audience and their goals.
        <img class="project-images-img" src="/assets/projects/bicyclenetwork_/b_bn_b.jpg" alt="image" />

        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            I believe that exceptional experiences are built and validated by the in-depth understanding of the audience. I’m a cyclist, commuting on my bike everyday and actively advocating for the safety on the road but I’ve never participated in a cycling event. I decided to register for one of the main events organised by Bicycle Network and cycle a 100km route around the bay. That was a great challenge but also an opportunity to fully understand the registration process, communication with the organisers before, during and after the event as well as talk to participants and members of the community.

        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            One of the main take aways from this activity, besides a shiny medal, was to recognise the main incentive for people to participate. They get together to build stronger community with fellow riders, challenge themselves and simply celebrate fun activity in a safe environment regardless of the age or fitness level. That sense of community had to be reflected in our solution.

        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            In order to define and agree on the content I performed an audit of the existing website. It happened to be a beginning of the most challenging part of the project. Since the organisation is very active and frequently publishes updates to keep their members in the loop about their initiatives, petitions and government grants there was hundreds of unrelated pages and links including posts, petitions and notes that were rarely viewed and rather hard to access. I mapped out all the content, analysed and compared against user goals and business values. As a result, we significantly reduced a number of pages and proposed a new, more intuitive information architecture.  
        </p>
        <img class="project-images-img" src="/assets/projects/bicyclenetwork_/d_bn_d.jpg" alt="image" />
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            Once we agreed on that, I worked closely with engineers to review technical capabilities and sketched initial wireframes. As the website was meant to be content managed, the key was to define consistent components and find smart, enagaging ways to present modular content.

        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            We run design critiques and reviews along the way to get feedback from the team and the client. As we wanted the project to be implemented as efficient as possible I frequently shared my work-in-progress designs with engineers to find the best solutions and discuss the most feasible approach.
        </p>

        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            After a few conversations with participants and closer look at the data I recognised that there’s a significant number of non-members who actively participate in the events but land directly on the event page not realising that they are organised by Bicycle Network. Overall visual language and co-branding was not adequate and did not provide actionable next steps to explore further or learn about the organisation. My solution to this problem was to create strong visual language with bold, recognisable graphics throughout the entire website and assign a unique colour (picked from the logo) for each of the event to easily distinguish them.

            Every event will also have a clear CTA and a link to the Membership page and other rides.
        </p>
        <p class="project-content-verbose">
            As the final step, I provided assets and specs and worked with engineers on edge cases and tweaks when necessary.
